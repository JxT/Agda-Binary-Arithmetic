# Verifying and Proving Binary Arthmetic in Agda

## Introduction
This is the Git repository for my final year project, which is exploring the verification and formal proof of arithmetic functions using the language and proof checker Agda.

## Outline
This repository is broken into folders, each for a different number representation - Natural, Two's Complement, Floating Point, Binary and Diadic.

Inside the folders are the various functions and proofs that have been created.

There is also an additional folder, 'Extra', for an implementation of Binary Trees as well as Lists, Vectors and Sets, which were not explicitly mentioned in the Interim Report.
